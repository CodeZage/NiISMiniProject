  - Hello there! How can I help you?
  - No need to be rude!
  - Yes, someone just ran through my store.
  - Thank you.
  - Actually now that you  mention it, I did hear the sound of heavy boots as the
    person ran through my store! Left muddy stains all over my stall.
  - Mmh... It looked like the person was carrying something, but I do not know what
    it was...
  - I did not get a good look at him! It all happened so fast!
  - Well.... I'm actually not sure... I just assumed, based on the large figure.
  - I'm sorry, I don't know. He just ran through my store.
  - Straight through my store, and then took a right turn up by the corner.
